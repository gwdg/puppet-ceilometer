puppet-ceilometer

This is the ceilometer module.

Limitations
--------------------------

The Ceilometer Openstack service depends on a sqlalchemy database. If you are using puppetlabs-mysql to achieve this, there is a parameter called mysql_module that can be used to swap between the two supported versions: 0.9 and 2.2. This is needed because the puppetlabs-mysql module was rewritten and the custom type names have changed between versions.
